Instructions: Right click the "Visual ARIA Bookmarklet" button, then choose Add to Favorites or Add to Bookmarks. The Visual ARIA Bookmarklet can then be run upon any webpage by choosing the bookmarklet from within your Favorites or Bookmarks menu.

Alternatively, the bookmarklet can be added manually within browsers such as Chrome and Safari, by activating New within the Bookmark Manager, then pasting the below code into the URL field.<br /><br />

Visual ARIA is a cascading logic program written using CSS, which allows any sighted person to physically see the use of ARIA upon any public website, including all landmark and region roles, structural roles, live regions, pseudo interactive constructs, and all interactive widget roles mapped within ARIA 1.1.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, Visual ARIA provides real-time visual feedback as interactive widgets are focused to and updated, and will also convey when widget roles are not being interacted with properly due to incorrect focus management or improper role usage.
</p>
<p>
Visual ARIA is meant to address the global problem that ARIA is an invisible technology, making it extremely difficult for mainstream sighted developers to understand and implement properly with consistent reliability.
</p>
<p>
For example, when developers who implement ARIA receive no direct input to validate their efforts during the process of development, and who have little to no understanding of how Assistive Technologies work, they have no way to assess the value of what they are doing, nor is there any way for them to learn from their mistakes at the same time. This is the primary reason why the vast majority of mainstream sighted developers still cannot understand the proper use of ARIA; because there is nothing for them to see.
</p>
<p>
Visual ARIA solves this problem by providing direct visual feedback for sighted engineers during the agile development process. The source code for Visual ARIA is included within the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/accdc/aria-matrices">ARIA Role Conformance Matrices</a> GitHub project as core mapping algorithms, which can be downloaded for offline usage or behind corporate firewalls.
</p>
<p>
Please file relevant bugs on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/accdc/aria-matrices">The ARIA Role Conformance Matrices GitHub project page</a> if issues are discovered.

Visual ARIA can be used within classrooms by educators to physically show sighted students what ARIA does and how it works, and how the improper use of ARIA causes accessibility issues when misapplied.
</li><li>
Sighted students can use Visual ARIA to evaluate their own projects as they learn accessible coding practices, with real-time feedback to identify their mistakes and coach them when necessary.
</li><li>
Online learning programs can incorporate Visual ARIA to provide real-time feedback as students build test widgets to practice through experience and repetition.
</li><li>
Sighted Quality Analysis teams can use Visual ARIA to reliably evaluate ARIA usage and related interactivity for all public and private services and products, without having to first understand or have experience using Assistive Technologies in advance.
</li><li>
Teams of sighted engineers can incorporate Visual ARIA within the development process to see how ARIA is being used within their projects, and whether ARIA is being used correctly according to spec when interacted with.
</li><li>
Any sighted person who is interested in ARIA can use Visual ARIA to see where and how ARIA is used on any website to better understand how Assistive Technology users are impacted by its use or misuse.

How It Works
</span>
</h2>
</div>

<div class="intro tal">
<p>
The bookmarklet script includes a small amount of JavaScript, which loads the Visual ARIA JavaScript setup file at:<br />
<a target="_blank" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/accdc/aria-matrices/master/The%20ARIA%20Role%20Conformance%20Matrices/visual-aria/roles.js">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/accdc/aria-matrices/master/The%20ARIA%20Role%20Conformance%20Matrices/visual-aria/roles.js</a>
</p>
<p>
This small JavaScript file then loads the <a target="_blank" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/accdc/aria-matrices/master/The%20ARIA%20Role%20Conformance%20Matrices/visual-aria/roles.css">roles.css</a> stylesheet, which comprises all of the Visual ARIA cascading logic functionality.
</p>
<p>
The JavaScript file then monitors the page for changes to ARIA roles and supporting attributes associated with HTML input and img elements, which is necessary since these elements don't support the use of the :before and :after CSS pseudo elements.
</p>
<p>
Since all of the processing power is handled using CSS, visual feedback by Visual ARIA is instantaneous, and should work correctly within any CSS3 compliant browser within any operating system on any desktop or mobile device.
</p>
<p>
Though the coaching advice within Visual ARIA is geared for desktop keyboard interactions, the ARIA spec compliance algorithms conveyed by Visual ARIA are applicable to both desktop and mobile platforms equally.

<h2>

Instructions for Use
</span>
</h2>
</div>

<div class="intro tal">
<p>
Visual ARIA is very simple to use.
</p>
<ol><li>
Navigate to the webpage that you wish to examine.
</li><li>
Activate the Visual ARIA Bookmarklet from your Favorites or Bookmarks menu, and wait for Visual ARIA to load.
<i>
The time for this may vary depending on the speed of your internet connection.
</i>
</li></ol>
<p>
You will then see various colored borders where ARIA roles are detected, and tooltips to convey their purpose and supporting attributes.
</p>
<p>
These borders and tooltips follow several distinct color schemes to identify the differences between static and interactive widget roles.
</p>
</div>

<div id="static-roles" class="hd" tabindex="-1">
<h3>
<span>
Static Roles
</span>
</h3>
</div>

<div class="intro tal">
<ul><li>
<span class="purpleTltp">
Purple border with purple tooltip: Identifies landmark and region roles.
</span>
</li><li>
<span class="blueTltp">
Blue border with blue tooltip: Identifies structural roles.
</span>
</li><li>
<span class="redTltp">
Red border with red tooltip: Identifies role usage errors within structural role usage.
</span>
</li></ul>
</div>

<div id="live-region-roles" class="hd" tabindex="-1">
<h3>
<span>
Live Region Roles
</span>
</h3>
</div>

<div class="intro tal">
<ul><li>
<span class="fuchsiaTltp">
Fuchsia border with fuchsia tooltip: Identifies live region roles and associated attributes.
</span>
</li></ul>
</div>

<div id="interactive-roles" class="hd" tabindex="-1">
<h3>
<span>
Interactive Roles
</span>
</h3>
</div>

<div class="intro tal">
<ul><li>
<span class="orangeTltp">
Orange border with orange tooltip: Identifies technically compliant interactive role usage. (Requires keyboard testing to validate functionality)
</span>
</li><li>
<span class="greenTltp">
Green border with green tooltip: Identifies technically compliant interactive role usage that matches the correct focus management for that role type.
</span>
</li><li>
<span class="redTltp">
Red border with red tooltip: Identifies role usage and focus management errors within interactive role usage.
</span>
</li></ul>
<p>
When interacting with keyboard accessible widget roles, the goal is to turn both the focus outline and border of the focused widget role <span class="greenTltp">green</span>. This conveys that focus management and ARIA widget role usage are correctly synchronized.
</p>
<p>
If however you see two different colored borders on the same widget role, such as <span class="orangeTltp">orange</span> and <span class="redTltp">red</span>, then focus management and ARIA widget role usage for this implementation are incorrect and not programmed according to spec.
</p>
<p>
<b>
Notes and limitations: Since the HTML img and input elements cannot support the use of the :before and :after CSS pseudo elements, tooltip and border coloration may sometimes differ.
Additionally, when ARIA role usage is right aligned, the tooltip text may run on past the right border of the screen, which unfortunately cannot be helped at this time.
