The ARIA Role Conformance Matrices
========

The purpose of The ARIA Role Conformance Matrices is not to list all possible attributes that can be used on all available roles, but rather, to specifically quantify how accessibility is tied into the usage of ARIA roles, and how associated roles are hierarchically mapped. 

Each ARIA role matrix is presented as a standalone table, where the left most Role column represents the hierarchical nesting association of related roles when applicable. 

All ARIA roles and supporting attributes within the Roles, Required Attributes, and Optional Attributes columns are active links that point to the ARIA 1.1 specification, which can be used for detail comparison, spec text logic testing, and bug identification. When a role name is capitalized, it is literally referring to the element that includes that particular role attribute. (This understanding is critical for the accessible implementation of ARIA.)
